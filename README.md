# Flutter MVVM + Provider + REST API

**Implements a Flutter app using the MVVM architectural pattern with Provider for state management and REST API integration.**  
This project demonstrates clean separation of concerns, scalable folder structure, and production-ready architecture suitable for real-world applications.

---

## Features

- MVVM architecture with **Provider** state management
- REST API integration for login, home, and other modules
- Splash screen and app initialization
- Reusable widgets and UI components
- Light & dark theme support
- Session & local storage management
- Error handling with custom widgets and API response handling

## Tech Stack

- **Flutter** (Dart)
- **Provider** for state management
- **MVVM architecture**
- **REST API integration**
- **Local storage** (SharedPreferences / custom session manager)
- **Theming** (Light & Dark)
- **Custom reusable widgets**

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
   flutter pub get
```

3. Run the app:
```bash
   flutter run
```

## Improvements / Next Steps

- Add more feature modules (e.g., Profile, Settings)
- Implement offline-first support
- Add unit & widget tests for MVVM layers
- Enhance error handling & loading states
